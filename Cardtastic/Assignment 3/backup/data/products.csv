p15|D&D Attack Wing Ogre Mage|Tales of ogre mages (or oni) have inspired fear in both children and adults throughout Faerun. And among these fearsome creatures, few inspire greater terror than the massive fiend known as Barsh. Filled with dark hunger, Barsh's superior strength allows him to rend his foes with his sharp claws or, when facing foes beyond close range, to wield a long-hafted magic glaive that lashes out with deadly precision.<br><br>An ogre mage's true powers, however, lie in his magical skill. Gifted with the power of enchanted flight, Barsh often takes to the skies, blasting his enemies with a frigid cone of cold or, when outnumbered by strong enemies, escaping their attacks by assuming a gaseous form. If any foes manage to wound him, he can rely on his powers of regeneration to quickly recover. Against the most formidable enemies, however, the ogre mage will put aside mundane weapons in favor of his Wand of the War Mage, a powerful magic item that helps ensure his victory when casting deadly spells.|../img/aw19.jpg|23.95|-1|miniatures

When surrounded by multiple foes, Bastian summons a magic fire shield that envelops his body in flames, protecting him from cold attacks and burning his attackers each time they strike him.<br><br>Bastian has no difficulty facing his own mortality, knowing that he is sure to die in a blaze of glory. His black armor is fused to his skin, and his heart has been ripped out and replaced with a heart of living flame. When Bastian dies, he knows that his heart will explode, sending splinters of the deadly metal armor flying in all directions to tear into his enemies. In fact, the anticipation of his own explosive end often causes Bastian to attack recklessly, not caring if his enemies wound him during battle, for the fearsome barbarian knows that he will most assuredly have the last laugh.|../img/aw20.jpg|19.5|-1|miniatures
